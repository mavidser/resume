    <p class="intro">
      I find joy in knowing a lot of things, and thrive in freedom to work on the larger product rather than owning contained components.
      I work as a language-agnostic full-stack developer, working on ways to develop/improve a product based on needs, available resources, and foresight. I excel at rapid prototyping and developing automation processes.
