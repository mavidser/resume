          I was the <b>sole developer</b> of the initial version of this product. I designed a functional UI in half a day, followed by months of coding.
          <hr>
          Like the Ship of Theseus, most code I wrote has likely been cycled out. And yet, the UI still survives, almost exactly the same.
          <hr>
          I am simultaneously annoyed and proud of this, given that I am <i>not</i> a professional UX designer.
